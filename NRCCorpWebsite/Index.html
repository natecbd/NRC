                NRC has provided valuable input into sustaining commercial, recreational and artisanal fisheries worldwide. Our work has addressed such critical problems as global bycatch and discards in fisheries, sustainability of large scale industrial fisheries, ecosystem based management and a great variety of more specific problems facing fisheries managers and users everywhere. Over the years, NRC has developed and maintained its own comprehensive databases and built relationships within the fishing industry, fisheries sciences, and regulatory bodies allowing for NRC's accurate and broadly informed insight into fisheries management issues everywhere.

                Economic Assessment and Impact
            </h3>                
            <div class="service-blurb">
                NRC's broad base of information regarding all aspects of fisheries business operations and economics has allowed us to be uniquely qualified and involved in numerous projects assessing economic impacts. Our access to in-house maintained databases of fisheries production, fisheries marketing, seafood pricing, seafood processing, fishing operations and fisheries economics have provided a sound basis for independent and accurate consulting in this area. Our contacts with commercial, recreational industry and government fisheries personnel have further strengthened our expertise in several projects over the years regarding economic assessment and impacts in fisheries. Key projects have specifically included Steller sea lion regulatory impact work in Alaska, Endangered Species Act salmon efforts in the Pacific Northwest and several others.
